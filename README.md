# Lease-Mileage-Calculator

A basic tool made to dip my toes in the waters of Java GUI (and because I worry too much about exceeding my lease mileage limit). This 
program reads your lease start date, yearly allowed mileage, and current mileage, to calculate whether or not you're driving too much for 
the terms of the lease. To run the program, download and open the provided [.jar file] (Lease Mileage Calculator.jar).
